* let error message fade out
* capture more useful informations from console output (to fill BiliPlaylist metadata)
* query url to get title & author
* handle exceptions
* play history and last played
* better use config system

future:

* download videos
** use aria2
* upload videos
* rewrite a native ruby Bilidan
* fetch URL and extract stuff to fill bilibili.tv tab
** develop a cache system, to compare timestamp, background update, etc 
* a navigation menu on bilibili tab and by default display top 10 videos with their link and preview image
* rearrange the video URLs, if it's not played yet, then update the stack.
* random play
